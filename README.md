# Arabic-to-English Translation with LSTM

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements an Arabic-to-English translation model using an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence architecture.

## Contents

### Notebook Overview
The notebook includes the following sections:


### Key Features
- **Dataset Preparation**: Prepares a bilingual Arabic-English dataset for training and evaluation.
- **Model Architecture**: Defines an LSTM-based encoder-decoder model for sequence-to-sequence translation.
- **Training Pipeline**: Includes functions for training the model with gradient clipping and computing the loss.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model on a validation dataset and computes the validation loss.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
- Additional libraries: numpy, matplotlib, and others specified in the notebook.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Follow the steps to preprocess the data, define the model, and train it.
3. Evaluate the model using the provided evaluation pipeline.

## Notes
- Padding and masking are handled carefully during training to ensure efficient learning.
- The training script clips gradients to avoid exploding gradient problems.

## Future Work
- Optimize the model for larger datasets.
